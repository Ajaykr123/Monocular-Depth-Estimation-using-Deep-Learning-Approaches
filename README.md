# Monocular-Depth-Estimation-using-Deep-Learning-Approaches
In this project, we extract depth information from RGB images using the NYU dataset. Various deep learning networks, such as UNet, Attention UNet, Residual UNet, and UNet++, have been employed. We have successfully extracted depth information from RGB images using these networks.
